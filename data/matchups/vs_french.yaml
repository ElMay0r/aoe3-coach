matchup: French
recommended_build: Fast Industrial (42 villagers Age I boom)
key_shipments:
  - Virginia Company
  - 3 Settlers
  - Town Militia
  - 6 Longbowmen
  - Highlanders
notes: |
  French players often execute a 12/10 Fast Fortress into grenadier rush. Build walls early and use Town Militia to snipe grenadiers:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.
  After reaching Age III, ship Highlanders or 6 Longbowmen to stabilize.
  Age up to Industrial quickly and send 3 Rockets to close the game.
