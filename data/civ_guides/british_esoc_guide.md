# ESOC British Guide (Summary)

This summary condenses advice from the ESOC forum guide “British Guide (from a top 10, maybe top 3 player)”. The original guide is humorous and uses colorful language; this version focuses on actionable tips.

## Opening (Age I)
1. Collect your starting crates, then build a **Manor House** and a **Market** near your Town Center to begin forming a wall:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
2. Research **Gang Saw** (wood cutting upgrade) at the Market and put most villagers on food, keeping at least five on food at all times:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
3. Ship **Virginia Company** as your first Home City card. It lowers the cost of Manors; immediately start building Manors in a wall formation:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
4. Ship **3 Settlers** as your second shipment:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
5. Ship **Town Militia** as your third shipment. This increases Town Center attack and lets you call extra militia for defense:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
6. Remain in Age I until you have ~20 Manors (17–18 minimum), then age up with the 200 coin politician (tower):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

## Age II and Beyond
- Use walls and Town Center fire to survive enemy rushes. Only call the full minutemen batch when absolutely necessary:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
- Transition to **Age III** (Fast Fortress) as soon as possible and ship units like **Highlanders** or **6 Longbowmen**, or economic shipments like **700 Wood/600 Coin**, depending on the matchup.
- In most matchups, a 42‐villager “Fast Industrial” (FI) is viable: stay in Age I, build 20 manors, age straight to Age III with the tower, then age to Age IV and ship **3 Rockets**:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
